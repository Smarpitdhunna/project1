            <p id="para1">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015)
                was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to
                2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
                spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came
                to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
                vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
                Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]
                Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
                President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single
                term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                civilian honour.</p>
            <p id="para2">Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002
                presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi
                Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.[39]

                On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that
                they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[40][41] and both the Samajwadi Party and the
                Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.[42][43] After the Samajwadi Party announced its support
                for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.[44] Kalam said
                of the announcement of his candidature:

                I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a
                message. I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.[45]

                On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his
                senior Cabinet colleagues.[46]


                Kalam along with Vladimir Putin and Manmohan Singh during his presidency
                The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies,
                with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone
                conclusion; the count was held on 18 July.[47] Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India
                in an easy victory,[48] and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.[49]
                Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                civilian honour, before becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Husain (1963)
                were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India.[50] He was also the
                first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.[51]</p>
